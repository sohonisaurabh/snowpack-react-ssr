# snowpack-react-ssr

This project uses a mix of ESM and CommonJS to implement SSR using react.
It works as given below:

There are 2 versions of app:
1. ESM version where there is only transpile of some JSX to JS
2. CommonJS version where complete app is run through @babel/preset-env and @babel/preset-react

SSR works as below:

1. App bootstraps with CommonJS version of server and content is rendered using CommonJS versions
 of app source files
2. On reaching the client, the browser makes request to ESM version of the app
3. After first hydrate, the app loads different pages by fetching required ESM modules on the fly

This project was bootstrapped using Snowpack's @snowpack/app-template-react template.
